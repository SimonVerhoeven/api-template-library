{"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"title":"MetaPub","description":"MetaPub collects, normalizes and distributes publicly available program, episode, and piece metadata through the public radio system. Backed by ContentDepot and its data model, MetaPub allows producers to supply metadata through various methods:\n\n1. MetaPub Agents that collect producer metadata by \"crawling\" existing public feeds (e.g. C24, BBC) or the producer's production system (e.g. ATC, ME, TED Radio Hour).\n2. Manually enter metadata in the ContentDepot Portal on each program and episode.\n3. Publish/push the metadata to the MetaPub upload API and execute an ingest job.\n\nMetaPub then distributes this data to stations through an electronic program guide (EPG model)\nfor display on various listener devices such as smart phones, tablets, web streams, HD radios, RDBS enabled FM radios, and more. The EPG format is based on the [RadioDNS specifications](https://radiodns.org/developers/documentation/).\n\n## RadioDNS and MetaPub\n\nThe RadioDNS Service and Programme Information Specification ([TS 102 818 v3.1.1](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102800_102899/102818/03.01.01_60/ts_102818v030101p.pdf)) defines three primary documents: Service Information, Program Information, and Group Information. These documents, along with the core RadioDNS Hybrid Lookup for Radio Services Specification ([TS 103 270 v1.2.1](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts%5C103200_103299%5C103270%5C01.02.01_60%5Cts_103270v010201p.pdf)) define a system where an end listener device can dynamically discover program metadata and fetch the metadata via Internet Protocol (IP) requests. MetaPub's use of RadioDNS differs slightly in that MetaPub (a.k.a PRSS) acts as the \"service provider\" while the stations and related middleware act as the end devices. While this is not the primary use case of RadioDNS, the flexibility in the specification, service definitions, and DNS resolution allows this model to be easily represented.\n\nThis documentation gives a high level overview of how the RadioDNS specifications will be used by MetaPub, however it is strongly recommended that the related RadioDNS specifications be read for implementation details, definitions, and required XML schemas.\n\n## ContentDepot Drive\n\nContentDepot Drive (CD Drive) provides a private, per customer file storage solution similar to other cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox. The CD Drive is used to stage content uploads such as metadata files, images, or segment audio before associating the content with specific programs or episodes.\n\nCD Drive content can be referenced using a URI by some operations such as synchronizing metadata. There are two possible CD Drive URI formats supported: ID and hierarchical path. The ID reference takes the form ```cddrive:id:{value}``` where value is the integer ID of the file or folder being referenced. The hierarchical path reference takes the form ```cddrive://{path}``` where path is the full, UNIX style path to the file or folder starting with '/'. For example, two CD Drive URIs pointing to the same file may be ```cddrive:id:12345``` and ```cddrive:///show1/episode2/metadata.xml```. More information about URIs can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe API currently uses OAuth 2.0.  Some operations require specific scopes to limit clients while the ContentDepot backend may also enforce existing user specific permissions.\n","termsOfService":"http://www.prss.org/terms-use","version":"2.0.0"},"servers":[{"url":"/"}],"tags":[{"name":"RadioDNS","description":"Endpoints to access the RadioDNS formatted electronic program guide (EPG) information for stations and middleware.","externalDocs":{"url":"https://radiodns.org/developers/documentation/"}},{"name":"CD Drive","description":"Endpoints to access ContentDepot Drive functionality such as uploading and downloading content files."},{"name":"MetaPub","description":"Endpoints to access MetaPub functionality such as synchronizing producer metadata to programs and episodes."}],"paths":{"/api/v2/cddrive/files/content":{"post":{"tags":["CD Drive"],"summary":"Upload a file.","description":"Upload a file to the customer's private CD Drive.","parameters":[{"name":"Content-MD5","in":"header","description":"If present, the MD5 will be compared against the file received as a message integrity check.","schema":{"type":"string","format":"md5"}}],"requestBody":{"content":{"multipart/form-data":{"schema":{"required":["file","name","parent-id"],"type":"object","properties":{"file":{"type":"string","description":"The file content being uploaded.","format":"binary"},"name":{"maxLength":255,"minLength":1,"pattern":"^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9 \\._]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$","type":"string","description":"The name of the file, including extension."},"parent-id":{"type":"integer","description":"The ID of the parent folder or 0 for the root folder.","format":"int64"}}}}},"required":true},"responses":{"201":{"description":"The file was created successfully.
