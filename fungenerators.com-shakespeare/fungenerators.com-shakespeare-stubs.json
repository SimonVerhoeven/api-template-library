Those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.  Kingdoms are clay;  O unhappy youth!  Come not within these doors; within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives.   This is no place; this house is but a butchery; Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it. When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time, My lungs began to crow like chanticleer That fools should be so deep contemplative; And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial. O noble fool!  A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.\\\",\\\"The wheel is come full circle.  But this denoted a foregone conclusion:  He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education.  And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow.  You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all our misery.\\\",\\\"Neither a borrower or a lender be.  Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what.  Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir; More, more, I prithee, more. And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock; Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags; 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine; And after one hour more 'twill be eleven; And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe, And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot; And thereby hangs a tale.'  The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound.  As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach.  Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.\\\",\\\"It is meat and drink to me to see a clown:  That's meat and drink to me, now.  The course of true love never did run smooth.  I will wear my heart upon my sleeve  A miserable world!  As I do live by food, I met a fool, Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun, And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms, In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.   At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms; Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.  Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious.  You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.\\\",\\\"It beggared all description.  more in sorrow than in anger.
