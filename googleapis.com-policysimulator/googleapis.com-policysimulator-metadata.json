{"slug":"googleapis-com-policysimulator","name":"googleapis.com:policysimulator","title":"Policy Simulator API","description":" Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and viewing a Replay. A `Replay` is a type of simulation that lets you see how your members' access to resources might change if you changed your IAM policy. During a `Replay`, Policy Simulator re-evaluates, or replays, past access attempts under both the current policy and your proposed policy, and compares those results to determine how your members' access might change under the proposed policy.","logo":"googleapis.com-policysimulator-logo.svg","logoMediaType":"image/svg+xml","tags":["analytics","media"]}
