  \ Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service.\
  \ Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push,\
  \ pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable\
  \ registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR\
  \ supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that\
  \ specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.</p>\
  \ <p>Amazon ECR has service endpoints in each supported Region. For more information,\
  \ see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html\">Amazon\
