Items may be\neither producs or discounts.\n\nA product is a synthetic construct, wrapping one or more variants (which is\nthe actual item being sold) Variants expresses different variations of\nproperties such as for example price, size or color. A discount will reduce\nthe total amount charged in a shopping cart. It can be used per item line,\nor on the whole cart. It may reduce the affected amount by a percentage, or\nby a fixed amount.\n\nTogether, the above types of entities makes up a complete library. The\nlibrary can be fetched as a whole through the library endpoint, where each\nconsecutive change applied to the library is available. Once the full\nlibrary is retrieved, only later events needs to be fetched to keep the\nclient up to date with the server\n\nAll path patterns \"/organizations/{organizationUuid}/\" can be replaced\nwith \"/organizations/self/\" for convenience as all endpoints are for\nauthorized users.","tags":["ecommerce"]}
