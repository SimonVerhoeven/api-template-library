description: "<p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service\
  \ that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing\
  \ to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source\
  \ system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized\
  \ applications. </p> <p>Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes\
  \ software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes\
  \ community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications\
  \ running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises\
  \ data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard\
  \ Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.</p>"
