description: "This document provides detailed specification of the Digital Locker\
  \ Pull APIs. The Pull model of integration with Digital Locker enables a Digital\
  \ Locker user to search a document/certificate from issuer repository and fetch\
  \ (pull) it into Digital Locker. The issuer departments can use these APIs for the\
  \ documents that are not Aadhaar seeded. The issuer organization integrating with\
  \ Digital Locker maintains the documents/certificates in its own repository (database\
  \ or file system). The issuer application provides APIs to Digital Locker to access\
  \ the documents in this repository. Each issuer organization will have to implement\
  \ 2 APIs to integrate with the Digital Locker system."
