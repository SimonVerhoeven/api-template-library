description: "<fullname>CodeBuild</fullname> <p>CodeBuild is a fully managed build\
  \ service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and\
  \ produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to\
  \ provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build\
  \ environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such\
  \ as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments\
  \ in CodeBuild to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet\
  \ peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more information\
  \ about CodeBuild, see the <i> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html\"\
  >CodeBuild User Guide</a>.</i> </p>"
