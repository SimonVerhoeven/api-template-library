## Adding or updating Templates

If you would like to contribute an API template to enable other WireMock users to build their own mocks based on your template, our website has a helpful [how to](https://www.wiremock.io/post/how-to-contributing-to-wiremock-api-templates-library) guide.
Please feel free to submit a pull request to the repository. (it may take some time to propagate the changes to[WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) or [WireMock Cloud](https://wiremock.io))

A template can be added to the featured list by adding the `featured` tag in the metadata JSON.
If a template is somehow related to WireMock, please also use the `wiremock` tag.
