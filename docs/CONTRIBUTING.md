Any contributions to the API Templates library are welcome!
Check out the [WireMock Contributor Guide](https://github.com/wiremock/community/edit/main/contributing/) for generic guidelines,
and see the sections below for particular contributing use-cases.

## Reporting issues

Please report any issues or feature requests as GitHub issues in the repository.
If you need help with troubleshooting, use the `#help` channel on
[WireMock Community Slack](https://slack.wiremock.org/).

## Adding or updating Templates

If you would like to contribute an API template to enable other WireMock users to build their own mocks based off your template,
feel free to submit a pull request to the repository.

A template can be added to featured list by adding the `featured` tag in the metadata JSON.
If a template is somehow related to WireMock, please also use the `wiremock` tag.

It may take some time to propagate changes to
[WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) or [WireMock Cloud](https://wiremock.io).
