{"name":"airbyte.local:config","title":"Airbyte Configuration API","description":"Airbyte Configuration API\n[https://airbyte.io](https://airbyte.io).\n\nThis API is a collection of HTTP RPC-style methods. While it is not a REST API, those familiar with REST should find the conventions of this API recognizable.\n\nHere are some conventions that this API follows:\n* All endpoints are http POST methods.\n* All endpoints accept data via `application/json` request bodies. The API does not accept any data via query params.\n* The naming convention for endpoints is: localhost:8000/{VERSION}/{METHOD_FAMILY}/{METHOD_NAME} e.g. `localhost:8000/v1/connections/create`.\n* For all `update` methods, the whole object must be passed in, even the fields that did not change.\n\nChange Management:\n* The major version of the API endpoint can be determined / specified in the URL `localhost:8080/v1/connections/create`\n* Minor version bumps will be invisible to the end user. The user cannot specify minor versions in requests.\n* All backwards incompatible changes will happen in major version bumps. We will not make backwards incompatible changes in minor version bumps. Examples of non-breaking changes (includes but not limited to...):\n  * Adding fields to request or response bodies.\n  * Adding new HTTP endpoints.\n","tags":["developer_tools"]}
