description: "<p>IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management,\
  \ sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to collect\
  \ and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local\
  \ events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices\
  \ can also communicate securely with Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT\
  \ data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda\
  \ functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices\
  \ for local operation.</p> <p>IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version\
  \ of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API\
  \ reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components,\
  \ manage deployments, and core devices.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"\
