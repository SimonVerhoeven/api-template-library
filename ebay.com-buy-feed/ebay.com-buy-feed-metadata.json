{"name":"ebay.com:buy-feed","title":"Item Feed Service","description":"Note: This is a (Limited Release) API available only to select developers approved by business units. The Feed API provides the ability to download TSV_GZIP feed files containing eBay items and an hourly snapshot file of the items that have changed within an hour for a specific category, date and marketplace. In addition to the API, there is an open source Feed SDK written in Java that downloads, combines files into a single file when needed, and unzips the entire feed file. It also lets you specify field filters to curate the items in the file.","tags":["ecommerce"]}
