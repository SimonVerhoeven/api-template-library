{"name":"apisetu.gov.in:issuer","title":"DigiLocker Issuer APIs","description":"This document provides detailed specification of the Digital Locker Pull APIs. The Pull model of integration with Digital Locker enables a Digital Locker user to search a document/certificate from issuer repository and fetch (pull) it into Digital Locker. The issuer departments can use these APIs for the documents that are not Aadhaar seeded. The issuer organization integrating with Digital Locker maintains the documents/certificates in its own repository (database or file system). The issuer application provides APIs to Digital Locker to access the documents in this repository. Each issuer organization will have to implement 2 APIs to integrate with the Digital Locker system.","tags":["open_data"]}
