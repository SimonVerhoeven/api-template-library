Once your app has completed this flow, you will still need to call `POST /v2/token` in order to swap the code for a valid access token.","operationId":"getAuthorizationPage","parameters":[{"name":"client_id","in":"query","description":"The client's ID","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"name":"redirect_uri","in":"query","description":"The client's URL to redirect to if the authentication is approved","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"name":"response_type","in":"query","description":"The type of response; currently, only `code` is supported","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string","enum":["code"]}},{"name":"scope","in":"query","description":"A space-separated list of scope(s) requested by the application","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"name":"email","in":"query","description":"An email address to prepopulate on the login screen","schema":{"type":"string"}},{"name":"state","in":"query","description":"A CSRF token generated by the client, to be roundtripped through the request for added security","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"responses":{"302":{"description":"The correct parameters were passed in and we are redirecting to the authentication page; OR, a valid `redirect_uri` was supplied but there was another error, and the error type and message are embedded in the querystring.","headers":{"Location":{"description":"The sign-in page to redirect to; most clients will process this redirect automatically.","schema":{"type":"string","format":"url"}}}},"400":{"description":"A bad request; generally, one or more parameters passed in were incorrect or missing.

The `scope` parameter can optionally be used to request a different set of scopes than were used in the original request, but it **cannot** contain any scopes that were not previously requested. If not specified, then `scope` will be set to whichever scopes were used for the original access token request. If trading in an old non-expiring access token for a refresh-enabled token, set the value of `refresh_token` to the access token value and `token_type_hint` must be set to `access_token`. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.\n\nThe `temporary_user` and `anonymous_user` grant types are custom grant types created by NPR to suit our needs for functionality such as our &quot;try-before-you-buy&quot; experience.

Our general guidance at this time is that if this endpoint starts returning refresh tokens for you, you are responsible for implementing the code to handle them appropriately in accordance with the OAuth 2.0 spec.
